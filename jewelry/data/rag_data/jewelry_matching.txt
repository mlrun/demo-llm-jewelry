**For your wife's birthday:**

* **Birthstones:** Select a piece featuring her birthstone for a personal touch, symbolizing different qualities like love (ruby), wisdom (amethyst), or happiness (citrine).
* **Pearls:** Timeless and elegant, pearls represent purity, innocence, and new beginnings - perfect for celebrating another year together.
* **Metals:** Opt for classic gold or silver, or explore rose gold for a touch of warmth and femininity.

**For your girlfriend's graduation:**

* **Gemstones:** Choose stones associated with success and achievement, like sapphire (wisdom and integrity), diamond (strength and perseverance), or emerald (growth and new beginnings).
* **Metals:** Silver is often associated with purity and new beginnings, while gold adds a touch of sophistication and celebration.

**Beyond Birthdays and Graduations:**

* **Anniversary:** Opt for gemstones associated with love and commitment, like ruby, diamond, or emerald. Consider matching the metal of your engagement rings for a unified look.
* **Mother's Day:** Pearls represent nurturing and maternal love, making pearl necklaces or earrings a classic choice. Gemstones associated with calmness and well-being, like amethyst or aquamarine, can also be thoughtful options.
* **Engagement:** Diamonds are the traditional choice for their symbolism of everlasting love and commitment. However, other gemstones like sapphires or emeralds can be chosen based on personal preference.

**For Special People:**
